### Description
These are some examples resulting from the saliency experiments.

The left-most image shows a heatmap where brigther regions represent portions of the input for which the classifier output is really "sensible to", i.e., the gradient is bigger.

The middle image is the orignal image.

The righ-most image is the original image occluded according to the heatmap. In other words, the "most important" regions are visible and viceversa.
