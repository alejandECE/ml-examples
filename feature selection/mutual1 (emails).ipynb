    "## Mutual Information\n",
    "In probability theory and information theory, the mutual information (MI) of two random variables is a measure of the mutual dependence between the two variables. More specifically, it quantifies the \"amount of information\" (in units such as shannons, commonly called bits) obtained about one random variable through observing the other random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mutual information of two jointly discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$ is calculated as a double sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray} \n",
    "  I(X;Y) = \\sum_{y \\in Y}\\sum_{x \\in X} p_{(X,Y)}(x,y) \\log \\left( \\frac{p_{(X,Y)}(x,y)}{p_X(x)p_Y(y)} \\right)\n",
    "\\tag{1}\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ p_{(X,Y)} $ is the joint probability mass function of $X$ and $Y$, and $p_{X}$ and $p_Y$ are the marginal probability mass functions of $X$ and $Y$ respectively."
