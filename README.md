## ml-examples
This is a extensive collection of examples demostrating core concepts, functionality and applications of machine learning, deep learning and data science in general. Most of these I used as code snippets in my lectures. The examples are grouped together in folders convering (in summary):

* [Bayesian Decision Theory](/bayesian%20decision%20theory) (Normal distributions, MVN, Bayes theorem, bayesian iterative learning ([Video](https://youtu.be/eVF82IoU3-Y)), probability of error, decision rules, regions and boundaries, GDA, LDA, regularized LDA, Naive Bayes, among others).

* [Linear Regression](/linear%20regression) (OLS, Robust Linear Regression, Laplace distribution, Huber Loss, Ridge Regression, LASSO, Bayesian Linear Regression).
This folder includes two examples of train and deployment of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) AI-Platform:
    * A regression example (using Tensorflow) found [here](/linear%20regression/keras%20gcp%20example%201).
    * A prediction example (using Tensorflow) found [here](/linear%20regression/keras%20gcp%20example%202).
    
* [Introduction to Gradient Descent](/gradient%20descend) (Numerical gradient, otimizers, line search, Newtwon's method, Adagrad, cost functions, among other). [Video](https://youtu.be/4W3Gf5-Z75o).

* [Logistic Regression](/logistic%20regression) (Logistic Regression (custom, using scipy.optimize toolbox and sklearn implementation), Softmax Regression, regularization, bias regularization effect). [Video 1](https://youtu.be/jGkTFk-MLh0), [Video 2](https://youtu.be/T1C6fTOUXkM).

The remaining description will be added shortly...
